This is the second team project at Startup Campus

## Case 1: Machine Learning (Supervised: Classification) 
### Banking Churn Prediction

**File:** [Assignment_02_Kelompok_E_Case_01](https://github.com/Elvhan/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Assignment_02_Kelompok_E_Case_01.ipynb)

### Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn in the banking sector by building and comparing three different machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The goal is to determine the most effective model for accurately predicting churn status, with the best model identified based on evaluation metrics. Hyperparameter tuning and feature selection are also applied to optimize model performance.

### Objectives
- **Build and Compare Models:** Develop three distinct models and compare their performance to find the most accurate and robust model.
- **Model Optimization:** Apply optimization techniques, such as hyperparameter tuning and feature selection, to improve model performance as needed.

## Case 2: Machine Learning (Unsupervised: Clustering)
### Data Segmentation with K-Means Clustering

**File:** [Assignment_02_Kelompok_E_Case_02](https://github.com/Elvhan/Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning/blob/main/Assignment_02_Kelompok_E_Case_02.ipynb)

### Overview
This project performs data segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm, focusing on identifying the optimal number of clusters for a given set of random data points.

### Objectives
- **Determine the Optimal Number of Clusters:** Identify the ideal number of clusters by calculating the Silhouette Score for different values of k (number of clusters).
- **Clustering:** Apply the K-means algorithm using the optimal number of clusters identified.
- **Visualize Clusters:** Create visualizations to display the resulting clusters.
